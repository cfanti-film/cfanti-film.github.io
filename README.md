# [C. Fanti Film Photography](cfanti-film.github.io)


Hi, I'm Christina Fanti. This is my film photography website.

I am a self-taught film photographer based in Phoenix, Arizona. Creating visual content is what I love to do most. My goal is to produce photos that tell a story and capture moments and experiences. From concerts to wildlife and landscapes, lifelong friends to strangers on the street, momentous occasions to average, day-to-day events â€“ I am inspired by the world around me and aim to capture its beauty through my work.
